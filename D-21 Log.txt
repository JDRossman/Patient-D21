Supervisor: Dr. J. D. Rossman (ID: 554677T)
Assistant: Rebecca Thompson (ID: 981263B)

21st September, 2453:
Patient remains in medically induced coma.
Patient has been deemed sufficiently stable for research. 
Patient has been suspended into axoaxonic liquid within LUCID chamber #43.
Vitals are green across the board.

22nd September, 2453:
Patient is responding well to the environment of the LUCID chamber.
No autoimmune response registered.
Vital centers of the brain remain dormant.
Scans show minimal brain activity.

23rd September, 2453:
Patient has been successfully brought out of medically induced coma. 
CT, XGT and MRI scans confirm no damage to vital brain functions. 
Experiments begin under approval of Dr. J. D. Rossman (ID: 554677T).

24th September, 2453:
Patient has undergone basic training is response to the LUCID environments.
Patient shows excelled ability to navigate basic scenarios. 
Patient has complete Scenario 1 and 2 28 (read: twenty-eight) times,
all with perfect marks.
Assistant Rebecca (ID: 981263B) will monitor patient through Scenario 3 and 4 
under the supervision of Dr. J. D. Rossman (ID: 554677T).

25th September, 2453:
Patient has shown no physical or emotional restrain against the Scenarios, completing 1 through 
4 with perfect marks everytime.
Dr. J. D. Rossman (ID: 554677T) deems patient qualified for the Construct. 
Patient has now begun to move freely through the LUCID environment.

26th September, 2453:
Patient shows remarkable talents in utilizing the Construct-systems. 
Patient experimented first, trying to get comfortable creating his own cycles, supported
only by the axonsuppression from the Construct. 
After 52 minutes of practice, patient succeeded in creating the same childhood vision
more than 43 (read: forty-three) times. The recreation included conversations with patient's parents,
Katherine Webb, #D-97, and Jonathan Webb, #D-53.
Cross-reference with Dr. P. Carlson (ID: 872213B) shows an astonishing 96 (read: ninety-six) percent accuracy in the
content of these conversations. 

27th September, 2453:
Patient is selfreliant in the LUCID systems and is no longer supported by the Construct.
Patient has been running self-created simulations without stop for more than 15 hours,
surpassing all expations. Current number of completed cycles stands at 522 (read: five-hundred and twenty-two).
Content of all current cycles can be found in
